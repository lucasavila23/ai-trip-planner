# Voice Trip Planner

A voice-powered trip planning prototype built for the IE University AI/ML course final project. The user speaks naturally to describe a trip; the app transcribes the audio, holds a multi-turn conversation to collect all necessary details, then scrapes real-time flights, hotels, and activities in parallel, and reads the results back aloud.

---

## Demo flow

```
User speaks → Whisper transcribes → Gemini converses →
  (confirmed) → 3 Playwright scrapers run concurrently →
    Pydantic structures each result → Gemini writes summary →
      UI renders tables + plays TTS audio
```

---

### Layer 1 — Data models (`models/schemas.py`)

All data contracts live in a single file. Every scraper, agent, and UI component imports from here — nothing defines its own schema inline.

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TripQuery` | Collected trip intent: origin, destination, dates, people, budget, confirmed flag |
| `Flight` | Single flight option |
| `FlightResults` | Wrapper list used with `with_structured_output` |
| `Hotel` | Single hotel option with cancellation info |
| `HotelResults` | Wrapper list |
| `Activity` | Attraction with a fixed Literal category enum |
| `ActivityResults` | Wrapper list |
| `TripResults` | Final assembled result: query + all three lists + summary text |

### Layer 2 — STT / TTS (`stt.py`, `tts.py`)

**Speech-to-Text** runs Whisper Small entirely locally. The HuggingFace pipeline is wrapped in `@st.cache_resource` so it loads once and stays hot across Streamlit reruns. Raw audio bytes from the mic recorder are read with `soundfile`, averaged to mono, cast to `float32`, and fed to Whisper.

**Text-to-Speech** uses `edge-tts` (Microsoft's free neural TTS, no API key). The async `speak()` coroutine is wrapped in `speak_sync()` which handles the `nest_asyncio` + running event loop edge case that Streamlit creates. Returns raw MP3 bytes that Streamlit plays directly with `st.audio(autoplay=True)`.

### Layer 3 — Conversation agent (`agents/conversation.py`)

`ConversationAgent` keeps a `messages` list and appends every turn (user + assistant). Each call invokes the LLM with `with_structured_output(_ConversationOutput)`, a small wrapper schema that holds:

- `reply: str` — the text to show the user
- `trip_query: Optional[TripQuery]` — only populated once the LLM has all details and `confirmed=True`

The system prompt instructs the model to ask one question at a time and only set `confirmed=True` when the user explicitly agrees to a summary. This avoids premature confirmation from partial answers.

### Layer 4 — Scrapers (`scrapers/`)

Each scraper follows the **exact two-stage pattern** from the course cheatsheet (S26.3):

**Stage 1 — Browser agent (raw text)**

A LangChain `ReAct` agent gets the full `PlayWrightBrowserToolkit` (7 tools: navigate, extract_text, extract_hyperlinks, get_elements, click_element, navigate_back, current_webpage). It receives a natural-language scraping goal and autonomously navigates the target site, returning raw text.

**Stage 2 — Structured output (typed objects)**

The raw text is passed to `get_llm().with_structured_output(XxxResults)`, which guarantees a validated Pydantic object. If stage 2 fails (e.g. the page returned garbage), an empty list is returned rather than crashing.

| Scraper | Target | Pydantic schema |
|---|---|---|
| `flights.py` | google.com/travel/flights | `FlightResults` |
| `hotels.py` | booking.com | `HotelResults` |
| `activities.py` | tripadvisor.com/Attractions | `ActivityResults` |

### Layer 5 — Supervisor (`agents/supervisor.py`)

`run_search()` fires all three scrapers concurrently with `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`. Individual failures are caught per-result — a `BaseException` instance means that scraper failed silently, and its slot becomes an empty list. The rest continue normally.

After gathering, a final Gemini call generates a 3-sentence spoken summary highlighting the best option from each category. This is the only sequential step after the parallel scrape.

The Playwright browser is created once via `@st.cache_resource` in `supervisor.py` and passed to each scraper call. All three scrapers share the same browser process.

### Layer 6 — UI (`app.py`)

Three logical sections driven by `st.session_state`:

| State | Section shown |
|---|---|
| No `trip_query` | Chat panel + mic recorder |
| `trip_query` set, not yet searched | Spinner while `run_search` executes |
| `trip_results` set | Three expanders with dataframes + summary audio |

`nest_asyncio.apply()` is called at the very top of `app.py` (before any imports that touch asyncio) because Streamlit runs its own event loop and `asyncio.gather` would otherwise deadlock.

## Technology choices and rationale

### LLM — Gemini 2.5 Flash

Chosen for its long context window (1M tokens), which is important for scraper output that can be verbose, and its structured output support via LangChain's `with_structured_output`. Flash tier is fast enough for interactive use and free via AI Studio. The model name is defined in exactly one place (`config.py`) so swapping to a different model requires a single edit.

### STT — Whisper Small (local)

Running Whisper locally avoids latency from a round-trip API call and eliminates the need for a second API key. The "small" checkpoint (244M parameters) fits easily in CPU RAM and transcribes a short voice clip in under 2 seconds on modern hardware. `@st.cache_resource` ensures the model loads once per session.

### TTS — edge-tts (local)

Microsoft's `edge-tts` library streams neural TTS audio without an API key by calling the same endpoint the Edge browser uses. `en-US-JennyNeural` is a natural-sounding conversational voice. Audio bytes are returned directly to Streamlit's `st.audio` component, which supports `autoplay=True` for a hands-free experience.

### Web scraping — Playwright + LangChain browser toolkit

Structured scraping APIs (e.g. dedicated flight APIs) either require paid keys or have strict rate limits. Playwright gives a real browser that handles JavaScript rendering, cookie banners, and dynamic content. The LangChain `PlayWrightBrowserToolkit` wraps it in 7 LangChain tools, letting a ReAct agent navigate autonomously without brittle CSS selectors. A single shared browser instance (cached in `supervisor.py`) avoids the overhead of launching three separate browsers.

### Structured outputs — Pydantic `with_structured_output`

Using `llm.with_structured_output(Schema)` guarantees that every field has the correct Python type (e.g. `price_eur: float`, not a string like `"€199"`). The LLM is also given conversion instructions ("convert to EUR if needed") in the stage-2 prompt, so currency mismatches are handled at the structuring step rather than in post-processing code.

### Orchestration — `asyncio.gather` (no agent framework for parallelism)

The three scrapers are independent and have no shared state, making `asyncio.gather` the right tool: simpler, more transparent, and faster than a LangGraph workflow for this use case. A full multi-agent framework would add indirection without benefit here.

### UI — Streamlit

Streamlit's session state model maps naturally to the app's three phases (conversation → loading → results). `streamlit-mic-recorder` provides a push-to-talk button that works directly in the browser without requiring OS-level microphone permissions setup.

## Environment details

- **Python**: 3.12
- **Virtual env**: `.venv/` (standard `venv`, not conda)
- **Pinned versions**: `requirements.lock.txt` (generated from the working install)
- **Playwright browser**: Chromium (headless)

## Common issues

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY not set` | `export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."` before running |
| `playwright install` not run | Run `playwright install chromium` inside the venv |
| Mic not working in browser | Allow microphone access when the browser prompts |
| `soundfile` read error on audio | Some browser mic encodings need `ffmpeg`; install with `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Scraper returns empty list | The target site may have changed layout — the LLM still extracts what it can |
| Streamlit rerun clears spinner | This is expected; state is preserved in `st.session_state` |
